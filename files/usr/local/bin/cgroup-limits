# This is a port to bash of a script originally written in python. I
# ported it because I wanted to avoid a dependency on python. I am
# not aware of who the original author is.

# =====================================================================

# Script for parsing cgroup information
# This script will read some limits from the cgroup system and parse
# them, printing out "VARIABLE=VALUE" on each line for every limit that is
# successfully read. Output of this script can be directly fed into
# bash's export command. Recommended usage from a bash script:
#     set -o errexit
#     export_vars=$(cgroup-limits) ; export $export_vars
# Variables currently supported:
#     MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES
#         Maximum possible limit MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES can have. This is
#         currently constant value of 9223372036854775807.
#     MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES
#         Maximum amount of user memory in bytes. If this value is set
#         to the same value as MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES, it means that
#         there is no limit set. The value is taken from
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes
#     NUMBER_OF_CORES
#         Number of detected CPU cores that can be used. This value is
#         calculated from /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus
#     NO_MEMORY_LIMIT
#         Set to "true" if MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES is so high that the caller
#         can act as if no memory limit was set. Undefined otherwise.
